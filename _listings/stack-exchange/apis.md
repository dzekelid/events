- name: Stack Exchange Get Event
  x-api-slug: stack-exchange
  description: "Returns a stream of events that have occurred on the site.\n \nThe
    API considers the following \"events\":\n - posting a question\n - posting an
    answer\n - posting a comment\n - editing a post\n - creating a user\n  \n \nEvents
    are only accessible for 15 minutes after they occurred, and by default only events
    in the last 5 minutes are returned. You can specify the age of the oldest event
    returned by setting the since parameter.\n \nIt is advised that developers batch
    events by ids and make as few subsequent requests to other methods as possible.\n
    \nThis method returns a list of events."
