      description: "Returns a stream of events that have occurred on the site.\n \nThe
        API considers the following \"events\":\n - posting a question\n - posting
        an answer\n - posting a comment\n - editing a post\n - creating a user\n  \n
        \nEvents are only accessible for 15 minutes after they occurred, and by default
        only events in the last 5 minutes are returned. You can specify the age of
        the oldest event returned by setting the since parameter.\n \nIt is advised
        that developers batch events by ids and make as few subsequent requests to
        other methods as possible.\n \nThis method returns a list of events."
